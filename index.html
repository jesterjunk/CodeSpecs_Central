            <hr>
            <p>
                EFI, or Extensible Firmware Interface, is a specification designed to replace the traditional BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) firmware interface in personal computers. Developed by Intel, EFI provides a more flexible, secure, and advanced interface between the operating system and the firmware. The Group is known as the UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface), which is managed by the Unified EFI Forum and it's website uefi.org.
                <br>
                <br>
                Key features of the EFI include:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Modularity</b>: EFI is designed to be modular, allowing for easy updates and customization.</li>
                <li><b>User Interface</b>: It supports a Graphics Output Protocol known as GOP, and a pre-boot environment that can run applications, making it more user-friendly than BIOS.</li>
                <li><b>Advanced Booting</b>: EFI supports booting from larger hard drives (over 2 TB) and uses the GUID Partition Table (GPT) instead of the Master Boot Record (MBR).</li>
                <li><b>Security</b>: It includes secure boot features that help prevent unauthorized operating systems and malware from loading during the boot process.</li>
                <li><b>Compatibility</b>: It provides backward compatibility with legacy BIOS services.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Overall, EFI enhances system performance, security, and usability compared to the traditional BIOS.</p>
